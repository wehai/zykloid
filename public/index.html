  <p>Do you know the game Telephone, also known as the messenger game? There are many names, and variants. Here the message will be an e-mail, and we won’t whisper, but draw, and write. </p>
  <p>Here you can make your first move by leaving one or more sentences.  </p>
  <p class="note">At this point I want to add, somebody will receive your message, so please be considerate and kind.</p>
  <p class="note2">It is like planting a seed. Put it here and see what will happen. But to have a healthy plant, it's important to take good care. Then it will brighten up your day.   </p>
  <p class="fließtext"> you play it like so: Sign Up with your email adress and your first turn/ entry. To do so press the play button. Then you need to wait until there are enough people to form a round. Then you all will recive a Mail with a text by another player. Now you have to reinterprit this with a drawing. To do so you have to click on the link in the Mail. Here you can try out the drawing field: <a href="/draw">draw here</a>. The next Mail that you will receive will contain a drawing by another player, which you have to answer with a text again (by following the link). This will happen until every frist entry from your round is bearbeitet, and everybody gave their senf. Then you can see the result in the <a href="/gallery"> gallery </a>.</p>
  <p class="etext"> have fun! and be creative</p>
